# Pseudo-motors
# Note: This databases will be in the next release of motor, not in zzzApp

# This is a simple example using the sumDiff2D database.  This takes 2 real motors and makes 2 soft motors,
# SUM which moves both motors together, and DIFF which moves them in opposite directions.
# It can be used for slits, for K/B mirror benders, etc.
