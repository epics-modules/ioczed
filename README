Edit configure/RELEASE to set the variable SUPPORT

If you don't want to build all of the default target architectures
(see the variable CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS in 
synApps/support/configure/CONFIG_SITE, or in base/configure/CONFIG_SITE),
then edit configure/CONFIG_SITE to set the variable CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS.

Edit iocBoot/ioc*/Makefile to set the variable ARCH
Edit iocBoot/ioc*/run to change zzz to your prefix minus the ':'

Edit start_epics_zzz, start_epics_zzz.bash, and setup_epics_common
to set the variables EPICS_APP and EPICS_APP_ADL_DIR

Edit iocBoot/ioc*/*.cmd and iocBoot/ioc*/*.substitutions
to agree with your hardware

If you're running with EPICS 3.14.12.5 or later, autosave should take care of
itself.  Otherwise, edit iocBoot/ioc*/auto*.req to agree with your software,
and disable autosaveBuild in iocBoot/ioc*/save_restore.cmd

chmod a+w,g+s iocBoot/ioc*/autosave

Run synApps/support/utils/changePrefix to change the prefix from 'zzz'
to whatever you want

Run make
